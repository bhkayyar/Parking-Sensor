1. 3 110V LEDs for signals - green, orange, red. 3 lamp sockets.
2. Relay board
3. 6 position terminal block x 2
4. 

On sink - attach proximity sensor to get bike position. 
    -- Sink + bike width (92.6 cm) = 0 position. 
    -- Distance of bike from sink + desired distance of car from bike + 0 position = final car sensor position.

Two entry sensors, E1 and E2. If E1 fires before E2, detect entry and turn system on.
    When on, if bike is more than 2 feet away, go into bike mode.
        Get B1 reading every 5s. If B1 reading has not changed in more than 45s, and bike is less than x feet from sink, set C1 position.
        Go off in 60s if power on not detected.
    When on, if bike is less than x feet away, go into car mode.
        Don't set C1 position. Get C1 reading every 500ms. If C1 reading > 4 feet, green light. If C1 reading <= 4 feet and >= 2 feet, orange light. If reading < 2 feet, red light.
        Go off in 60s if power on not detected.
